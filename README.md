## Dependencies

This [React](https://reactjs.org/) component library leverages [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) and [Styled System](https://styled-system.com/) as well as a few other key packages. In order to keep this package light and simple, we don't include them as main dependecies but rather as [peerDependencies](http://npm.github.io/using-pkgs-docs/package-json/types/peerdependencies.html)

They make our lives easier, but you'll have to make sure your own project includes them as well.
